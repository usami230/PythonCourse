# Write a program to ask user its name and check whether name consists of 5 or more letters

# Write a program that accepts 3 inputs from user. input 1 and input 2 should be numbers and the third input should be mathematical operator. 
# Perform operation accordingly
# for example

# then output should be 15
# input1 is 5 and input2 is 10 and input3 is *
# then output should be 50

# Write a program that accepts 1 input from user and check if the number is divisible by 2 and 3 both.
# for example
# input1 is 10
# output should be "10 is only divisible by 2"
# input1 is 9
# output should be "9 is only divisible by 3"
# input1 is 12
# output should be "12 is divisible by 2 and 3"

# Write a program that accepts 2 inputs from user and check which number is largest.
# for example:
# input1 is 5 and input2 is 10
# output should be 10 as this number is larger than 5

# Write a program that accepts 3 input from user and check which number is largest.
# for example:
# input1 is 5 and input2 is 10 and input3 is 15
# output should be 15 as this number is larger than 5 and 10

# Write a program that accepts 3 input from user and check the second largest.
# for example:
# input1 is 5 and input2 is 10 and input3 is 15
# output should be 10 as this number is larger than 5 and smaller than 15
